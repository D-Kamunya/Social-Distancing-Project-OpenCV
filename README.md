# Social Distancing Project

Hello everyone, we have understood by now that how social distancing can really help in breaking the chain.
Being a Computer Vision enthusiast, I have tried to built a model which can detect the number of faces and can show a message if the faces are very close to each other. 
This can be a small prototype of a model which can be implemented through the CCTV cameras for surveillance by the police. It can be integrated with mobile applications so that violation of social distancing can be easily reported.
I would like to thank Vimal Daga LinuxWorld India for the ideation and for the great tutorials on computer vision.
